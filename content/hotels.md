# Accommodation

If you want to keep costs down, avoid central Como prices and stay in nearby areas with simple transport.

## Best Budget Bases

### Grandate (Best value if you have a car)
- **Why:** Affordable rates and easy road access.

### Tavernola (Good compromise: lake feel, often cheaper)
- **Why:** Lakeside atmosphere, often less expensive than central Como.
