# Accommodation

The wedding is in Lake Como, but we will be staying in Varedo, about a 40 minute drive from Como. We recommend staying near Como on the Friday & Saturday to make transport to and from the venue easier, though we also do advise that hotels are more expensive the closer you are to Como.
