# Accommodation

The wedding is in Lake Como, but we will be staying in Varedo (40 mins away). For the best experience, we recommend staying closer to Como for the Friday & Saturday.

## 💡 "Smart Stay" Budget Options
Standard hotels in Como center can be expensive. These nearby spots offer great value and reliable transport to the venue.

### Como Camerlata (The Smartest Choice)
- **Why:** Only 4 mins away by train and much more affordable.
- **Late Night Return:** Catch the 00:11 (12:11 AM) train from Como San Giovanni station.
- **Stay:** [B&B Hotel Como Camerlata](https://www.hotel-bb.com/en/hotel/como-camerlata)

### Tavernola (Lakeside Vibes)
- **Why:** Stay on the lake without the central city price tag.
- **Late Night Return:** Take the N1 Bus (~00:07 AM) or enjoy a scenic 25-min walk along the lake.
- **Stay:** Great local B&Bs and Airbnbs in this area.

### Grandate (Ideal if you have a car)
- **Why:** Right off the highway and very budget-friendly.
- **Note:** The last train is early (22:16), so plan for a ~€20 taxi back.
