I'll begin verifying the travel logistics for your late-night return from Yacht Club Como to the nearby towns. I'll check the current status of the ASF FLEX service, confirm the last S11 Trenord train departure on Saturdays, and verify taxi details, including any seasonal surcharges. I'll provide you with structured, up-to-date information and official links.


I’ve attached the complete report in a file: {{file:file-3qZV3umgxgxNdrX2hPQiiE}}.

In summary, the ASF Flex Urbano on-demand bus service for Como’s urban area remains active on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. The official ASF page confirms operations from 21:10 to 01:00, with a crucial extension until 01:30 on Saturdays, and a fare of €2.50 per ride (free for season-pass holders). Bookings can be made via the ASF Flex app or call centre up to one hour before the ride; the service is suspended on 15 August, 25 December and 1 January. ASF Flex’s app listings on Google Play and Apple App Store provide download links and show recent updates in early 2026. This clarifies that the older link “/it/flex-urbano” is now redirected or superseded by the current “/asf-flex-urbano/” page.

I also discovered that Trenord’s official S11 timetable lists the last train from Como at 00:11, yet real-time schedules via SBB show that on Saturdays the final S11 departure from Como S. Giovanni to Camerlata is actually at 23:20, leaving a gap until the early morning train at 04:36. This indicates that passengers returning late from Yacht Club Como should not rely on a 00:11 train. For taxi options, Radio Taxi Como remains accessible 24/7 via phone (031 261515) or the InTaxi app, and a March 2024 tariff update shows a base fare of €7.50 at night and a 20 % surcharge for groups of 5–8 passengers. Pre‑booking requires calling the dispatch centre with details of the trip; confirmation is only given if cars are available and there are no refunds for unfulfilled bookings. Together, these findings provide a clear plan for late-night travel from Como: book ASF Flex before 00:30 (Saturday), catch the 23:20 train if preferred, or pre‑arrange a taxi with potential surcharges in mind.

Feel free to ask if you need anything else.
