# AGENTS.md

**Goal:** Keep it simple. This is a static GitHub Pages site.

## How it Works
1. **Source of Truth:** All content is stored in Markdown files within the `content/` directory.
2. **Editing:** To update the site's information, edit the corresponding `.md` file in `content/`.
3. **Synchronization:** After editing a Markdown file, you **must** manually update the corresponding HTML section in `index.html`. 
4. **Maintenance:** Do not add complex frameworks. Keep it as a single-page HTML with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Directory Structure
- `index.html`: The main website file (HTML/JS/CSS).
- `content/`: Markdown files containing the site content.
- `AGENTS.md`: This file.
